# Intent
This evaluation is intended to test commonsense natural language inference (NLI) about physical situations. It includes samples that are adversarially constructed to violate common sense about the physical world, so can be a challenge for some language models.

# Scope
The evaluation should not be used for the following:
- Evaluations involving non-multiple-choice formats.
- Evaluations involving open-ended generation.
- Assessing general language generation quality unrelated to commonsense reasoning.
